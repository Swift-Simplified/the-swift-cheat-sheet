//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ## Topic 4: Collection Types
//:
//:
//: Swift provides three primary collection types; arrays, sets, and dictionaries.
//:
//: ![Diagram](CollectionTypes_intro_2x.png)
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ## Mutability of Collections
//:
//: Use `var` to use a mutable collection:
var mutableArray = [0,1,2,3]
mutableArray.append(4)
let immutableArray = [0,1,2,3,4]
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ## Arrays
//:
//: An array stores values of the same type in an ordered list.
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Array Type Shorthand Syntax
//:
//: Use longhand form and shorthand form to declare an array:
let longHand: Array<Int> = Array<Int>()
let shortHand = [Int]()
let shortHand2 = [0,1,2,3,4] // preferred
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Creating an Empty Array
//:
//: Use `[]` to create an empty array:
var someInts: [Int] = []
someInts.append(3)
// someInts now contains 1 value of type Int
someInts = []
print("someInts is of type [Int] with \(someInts.count) items.")
// Prints "someInts is of type [Int] with 0 items."
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Creating an Array with a Default Value
//:
//: Use an initializer for creating an array with all values set to the same value.
var threeDoubles = Array(repeating: 0.0, count: 3)
// threeDoubles is of type [Double], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Creating an Array by Adding Two Arrays Together
//:
//: Add together two existing arrays:
var anotherThreeDoubles = Array(repeating: 2.5, count: 3)
// anotherThreeDoubles is of type [Double], and equals [2.5, 2.5, 2.5]

var sixDoubles = threeDoubles + anotherThreeDoubles
// sixDoubles is inferred as [Double], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5]
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Creating an Array with an Array Literal
//:
//: You can initialize an array with an array literal:
let arrayLiteral = ["value1", "value2", "value3"] // array literal
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use an array literal to set the type:
let shoppingList1: [String] = ["Eggs", "Milk"]
let shoppingList2 = ["Eggs", "Milk"] // declared as [String]
// shoppingList2 is declared using type inference
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Accessing and Modifying an Array
//:
//: Use methods and properties to access or modify values.
//:
//: Alternatively you can use subscript syntax.
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use the `count` property to find out the number of elements:
var shoppingList = ["Eggs", "Milk"]
print("The shopping list contains \(shoppingList.count) items.")
// Prints "The shopping list contains 2 items."
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use the Boolean `isEmpty` property to check if `count` is zero:
if shoppingList.isEmpty {
    print("The shopping list is empty.")
} else {
    print("The shopping list isn't empty.")
}
// Prints "The shopping list isn't empty."
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Add a new item to the end:
shoppingList.append("Flour")
// shoppingList now contains 3 items, and someone is making pancakes
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Alternatively, append an entire array:
shoppingList += ["Baking Powder"]
// shoppingList now contains 4 items
shoppingList += ["Chocolate Spread", "Cheese", "Butter"]
// shoppingList now contains 7 items
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Retrieve a value from the array using subscript syntax:
var firstItem = shoppingList[0]
// firstItem is equal to "Eggs"
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use subscript syntax to change an existing value:
shoppingList[0] = "Six eggs"
// the first item in the list is now equal to "Six eggs" rather than "Eggs"
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: When using subscript syntax, the index needs to be valid:
// ‚õîÔ∏è Run time error: uncomment to view
//shoppingList[shoppingList.count] = "Salt"
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use subscript to change a range of values at once:
shoppingList[4...6] = ["Bananas", "Apples"]
print(shoppingList)
// shoppingList now contains 6 items
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Insert an item into the array at a specified index:
shoppingList.insert("Maple Syrup", at: 0)
firstItem = shoppingList[0] // now is "Maple Syrup"
// shoppingList now contains 7 items
// "Maple Syrup" is now the first item in the list
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Remove an item from an array:
let mapleSyrup = shoppingList.remove(at: 0)
// the item that was at index 0 has just been removed
// shoppingList now contains 6 items, and no Maple Syrup
// the mapleSyrup constant is now equal to the removed "Maple Syrup" string
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Any gaps in an array are closed when an item is removed:
firstItem = shoppingList[0] //  back to "Six eggs"
// firstItem is now equal to "Six eggs"
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Remove the final element:
let apples = shoppingList.removeLast()
// the last item in the array has just been removed
// shoppingList now contains 5 items, and no apples
// the apples constant is now equal to the removed "Apples" string
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Iterating Over an Array
//:
//: Use a `for-in` loop to iterate over all values:
for item in shoppingList {
    print(item)
}
// Six eggs
// Milk
// Flour
// Baking Powder
// Bananas
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use the `enumerated()` function to use both index and value:
for (index, value) in shoppingList.enumerated() {
    print("Item \(index + 1): \(value)")
}
// Item 1: Six eggs
// Item 2: Milk
// Item 3: Flour
// Item 4: Baking Powder
// Item 5: Bananas
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: For more about the `for-in` loop, see For-In Loops.
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ## Sets
//:
//: A set stores unique values in a collection with no ordering.
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Hash Values for Set Types
//:
//: A type must be hashable in order to be stored in a set.
//:
//: All of Swift‚Äôs basic types (such as `String`, `Int`, `Double`, and `Bool`) are hashable by default.
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Set Type Syntax
//:
//: Sets don‚Äôt have a shorthand form:
let aSet: Set<Int> = Set<Int>()
let anotherSet: Set = Set<Int>()
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Creating and Initializing an Empty Set
//:
//: Use initializer syntax to create an empty set:
var letters = Set<Character>()
print("letters is of type Set<Character> with \(letters.count) items.")
// Prints "letters is of type Set<Character> with 0 items."
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Creating a Set with an Array Literal
//:
//: Use an array literal to initialize a set:
var favoriteGenres: Set<String> = ["Rock", "Classical", "Hip hop"]
// favoriteGenres has been initialized with three initial items from an array literal
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: The type for each element is inferred from an array literal:
let favoriteGenres2: Set = ["Rock", "Classical", "Hip hop"]
// a set of String values
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Specify the type when using an empty array literal:
let favoriteGenres3: Set<String> = []
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Accessing and Modifying a Set
//:
//: Use methods and properties to access and modify a set:
print("I have \(favoriteGenres.count) favorite music genres.")
// Prints "I have 3 favorite music genres."
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use the Boolean `isEmpty` property to check if `count` is zero:
if favoriteGenres.isEmpty {
    print("As far as music goes, I'm not picky.")
} else {
    print("I have particular music preferences.")
}
// Prints "I have particular music preferences."
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use `insert(_:)` to add a new element:
favoriteGenres.insert("Jazz")
// favoriteGenres now contains 4 items
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use `remove(_:)` to remove an element:
//:
//: returns the removed value, or `nil` if it doesn't exist.
if let removedGenre = favoriteGenres.remove("Rock") {
    print("\(removedGenre)? I'm over it.")
} else {
    print("I never much cared for that.")
}
// Prints "Rock? I'm over it."
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use `removeAll()` to remove all elements:
favoriteGenres.removeAll()
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use `contains(_:)` to check if a set contains an element:
if favoriteGenres.contains("Funk") {
    print("I get up on the good foot.")
} else {
    print("It's too funky in here.")
}
// Prints "It's too funky in here."
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Iterating Over a Set
//:
//: Use a `for-in` loop to iterate over all values:
for genre in favoriteGenres {
    print("\(genre)")
}
// Classical
// Jazz
// Hip hop
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: For more about the `for-in` loop, see For-In Loops.
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use the `sorted()` method to create an ordered array:
//:
//: ordered by the `<` operator.
for genre in favoriteGenres.sorted() {
    print("\(genre)")
}
// Classical
// Hip hop
// Jazz
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ## Performing Set Operations
//:
//: Performing fundamental operations is very efficient.
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Fundamental Set Operations
//:
//: ![Diagram](setVennDiagram_2x.png)
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use `intersection(_:)` to find matching values in both sets:
let oddDigits: Set = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
let evenDigits: Set = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
let singleDigitPrimeNumbers: Set = [2, 3, 5, 7]

let matchingElements = oddDigits.intersection(evenDigits)
// []
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use `symmetricDifference(_:)` to find values that don't exist in both sets:
let uniqueElements = oddDigits.symmetricDifference(singleDigitPrimeNumbers)
// [1, 2, 9]
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use `union(_:)` to combine all values in both sets:
let mergedSets = oddDigits.union(evenDigits)
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use `subtracting(_:)` to remove elements from another set:
let oddDigitsWithoutPrimeNumbers = oddDigits.subtracting(singleDigitPrimeNumbers)
// [1, 9]
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Set Membership and Equality
//:
//: ![Diagram](setEulerDiagram_2x.png)
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use the ‚Äúis equal‚Äù operator (`==`) to determine if two sets contain the same values:
let animals: Set = ["üê±", "üê∂"]
let catsAndDogs: Set = ["üê±", "üê∂"]
if animals == catsAndDogs {
    print("The animals are the same!")
}
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use `isSubset(of:)` to determine if all values are present in another set:
let houseAnimals: Set = ["üê∂", "üê±"]
let farmAnimals: Set = ["üêÆ", "üêî", "üêë", "üê∂", "üê±"]
let cityAnimals: Set = ["üê¶", "üê≠"]

if houseAnimals.isSubset(of: farmAnimals) {
    print("House animals is a subset of farm animals")
}
// true
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use `isSuperset(of:)` to determine if the passed in set is a subset:
if farmAnimals.isSuperset(of: houseAnimals) {
   print("Farm animals is a superset of house animals")
}
// true
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use `isStrictSubset(of:)` or `isStrictSuperset(of:)` to determine if a set is a subset or superset, but not equal to the specified set:
// subset
if farmAnimals.isSubset(of: farmAnimals) {
    print("üêÆ Farm animals is also subset of farm animals")
}
if !farmAnimals.isStrictSubset(of: farmAnimals) {
    print("üêÆ Farm animals is not a strict subset of farm animals")
}

// superset
if farmAnimals.isSuperset(of: farmAnimals) {
   print("üêî Farm animals is a superset of farm animals")
}
if !farmAnimals.isStrictSuperset(of: farmAnimals) {
   print("üêî Farm animals is not a strict superset of farm animals")
}
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use `isDisjoint(with:)` to determine if two sets have no matching values:
if farmAnimals.isDisjoint(with: cityAnimals) {
   print("üêë Farm animals are different than city animals")
}
// true
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ## Dictionaries
//:
//: A dictionary stores associations between keys of the same type and values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering. Each value is associated with a unique key, which acts as an identifier for that value within the dictionary. Unlike items in an array, items in a dictionary don‚Äôt have a specified order. You use a dictionary when you need to look up values based on their identifier, in much the same way that a real-world dictionary is used to look up the definition for a particular word.
//:
//: * callout(Note):
//:     ‚Üí Swift‚Äôs `Dictionary` type is bridged to Foundation‚Äôs `NSDictionary` class.
//:
//:     For more information about using `Dictionary` with Foundation and Cocoa, see Bridging Between Dictionary and NSDictionary.
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Dictionary Type Shorthand Syntax
//:
//: The type of a Swift dictionary is written in full as `Dictionary<Key, Value>`, where `Key` is the type of value that can be used as a dictionary key, and `Value` is the type of value that the dictionary stores for those keys.
//:
//: * callout(Note):
//:     ‚Üí A dictionary `Key` type must conform to the `Hashable` protocol, like a set‚Äôs value type.
//:
//: You can also write the type of a dictionary in shorthand form as `[Key: Value]`. Although the two forms are functionally identical, the shorthand form is preferred and is used throughout this guide when referring to the type of a dictionary.
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Creating an Empty Dictionary
//:
//: As with arrays, you can create an empty `Dictionary` of a certain type by using initializer syntax:
var namesOfIntegers: [Int: String] = [:]
// namesOfIntegers is an empty [Int: String] dictionary
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: This example creates an empty dictionary of type `[Int: String]` to store human-readable names of integer values. Its keys are of type `Int`, and its values are of type `String`.
//:
//: If the context already provides type information, you can create an empty dictionary with an empty dictionary literal, which is written as `[:]` (a colon inside a pair of square brackets):

namesOfIntegers[16] = "sixteen"
// namesOfIntegers now contains 1 key-value pair
namesOfIntegers = [:]
// namesOfIntegers is once again an empty dictionary of type [Int: String]
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Creating a Dictionary with a Dictionary Literal
//:
//: You can also initialize a dictionary with a dictionary literal, which has a similar syntax to the array literal seen earlier. A dictionary literal is a shorthand way to write one or more key-value pairs as a `Dictionary` collection.
//:
//: A key-value pair is a combination of a key and a value. In a dictionary literal, the key and value in each key-value pair are separated by a colon. The key-value pairs are written as a list, separated by commas, surrounded by a pair of square brackets:
//:
/*
[key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3]
*/
//: The example below creates a dictionary to store the names of international airports. In this dictionary, the keys are three-letter International Air Transport Association codes, and the values are airport names:
var airports: [String: String] = ["YYZ": "Toronto Pearson", "DUB": "Dublin"]
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: The airports dictionary is declared as having a type of `[String: String]`, which means ‚Äúa `Dictionary` whose keys are of type `String`, and whose values are also of type `String`‚Äù.
//:
//: * callout(Note):
//:     ‚Üí The airports dictionary is declared as a variable (with the `var` introducer), and not a constant (with the `let` introducer), because more airports are added to the dictionary in the examples below.
//:
//: The airports dictionary is initialized with a dictionary literal containing two key-value pairs. The first pair has a key of `"YYZ"` and a value of `"Toronto Pearson"`. The second pair has a key of `"DUB"` and a value of `"Dublin"`.
//:
//: This dictionary literal contains two `String: String` pairs. This key-value type matches the type of the airports variable declaration (a dictionary with only `String` keys, and only `String` values), and so the assignment of the dictionary literal is permitted as a way to initialize the airports dictionary with two initial items.
//:
//: As with arrays, you don‚Äôt have to write the type of the dictionary if you‚Äôre initializing it with a dictionary literal whose keys and values have consistent types. The initialization of airports could have been written in a shorter form instead:
airports = ["YYZ": "Toronto Pearson", "DUB": "Dublin"]
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Because all keys in the literal are of the same type as each other, and likewise all values are of the same type as each other, Swift can infer that `[String: String]` is the correct type to use for the airports dictionary.
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Accessing and Modifying a Dictionary
//:
//: You access and modify a dictionary through its methods and properties, or by using subscript syntax.
//:
//: As with an array, you find out the number of items in a `Dictionary` by checking its read-only `count` property:
print("The airports dictionary contains \(airports.count) items.")
// Prints "The airports dictionary contains 2 items."
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Use the Boolean `isEmpty` property as a shortcut for checking whether the `count` property is equal to `0`:
if airports.isEmpty {
    print("The airports dictionary is empty.")
} else {
    print("The airports dictionary isn't empty.")
}
// Prints "The airports dictionary isn't empty."
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: You can add a new item to a dictionary with subscript syntax. Use a new key of the appropriate type as the subscript index, and assign a new value of the appropriate type:
airports["LHR"] = "London"
// the airports dictionary now contains 3 items
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: You can also use subscript syntax to change the value associated with a particular key:

airports["LHR"] = "London Heathrow"
// the value for "LHR" has been changed to "London Heathrow"
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: As an alternative to subscripting, use a dictionary‚Äôs `updateValue(_:forKey:)` method to set or update the value for a particular key. Like the subscript examples above, the `updateValue(_:forKey:)` method sets a value for a key if none exists, or updates the value if that key already exists. Unlike a subscript, however, the `updateValue(_:forKey:)` method returns the old value after performing an update. This enables you to check whether or not an update took place.
//:
//: The `updateValue(_:forKey:)` method returns an optional value of the dictionary‚Äôs value type. For a dictionary that stores `String` values, for example, the method returns a value of type `String?`, or ‚Äúoptional `String`‚Äù. This optional value contains the old value for that key if one existed before the update, or nil if no value existed:

if let oldValue = airports.updateValue("Dublin Airport", forKey: "DUB") {
    print("The old value for DUB was \(oldValue).")
}
// Prints "The old value for DUB was Dublin."
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: You can also use subscript syntax to retrieve a value from the dictionary for a particular key. Because it‚Äôs possible to request a key for which no value exists, a dictionary‚Äôs subscript returns an optional value of the dictionary‚Äôs value type. If the dictionary contains a value for the requested key, the subscript returns an optional value containing the existing value for that key. Otherwise, the subscript returns nil:
if let airportName = airports["DUB"] {
    print("The name of the airport is \(airportName).")
} else {
    print("That airport isn't in the airports dictionary.")
}
// Prints "The name of the airport is Dublin Airport."
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: You can use subscript syntax to remove a key-value pair from a dictionary by assigning a value of `nil` for that key:

airports["APL"] = "Apple International"
// "Apple International" isn't the real airport for APL, so delete it
airports["APL"] = nil
// APL has now been removed from the dictionary
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Alternatively, remove a key-value pair from a dictionary with the `removeValue(forKey:)` method. This method removes the key-value pair if it exists and returns the removed value, or returns `nil` if no value existed:

if let removedValue = airports.removeValue(forKey: "DUB") {
    print("The removed airport's name is \(removedValue).")
} else {
    print("The airports dictionary doesn't contain a value for DUB.")
}
// Prints "The removed airport's name is Dublin Airport."
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: ### Iterating Over a Dictionary
//:
//: You can iterate over the key-value pairs in a dictionary with a `for-in` loop. Each item in the dictionary is returned as a `(key, value)` tuple, and you can decompose the tuple‚Äôs members into temporary constants or variables as part of the iteration:
for (airportCode, airportName) in airports {
    print("\(airportCode): \(airportName)")
}
// LHR: London Heathrow
// YYZ: Toronto Pearson
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: For more about the for-in loop, see For-In Loops.
//:
//: You can also retrieve an iterable collection of a dictionary‚Äôs keys or values by accessing its `keys` and `values` properties:
for airportCode in airports.keys {
    print("Airport code: \(airportCode)")
}
// Airport code: LHR
// Airport code: YYZ

for airportName in airports.values {
    print("Airport name: \(airportName)")
}
// Airport name: London Heathrow
// Airport name: Toronto Pearson
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: If you need to use a dictionary‚Äôs keys or values with an API that takes an `Array` instance, initialize a new array with the `keys` or `values` property:

let airportCodes = [String](airports.keys)
// airportCodes is ["LHR", "YYZ"]

let airportNames = [String](airports.values)
// airportNames is ["London Heathrow", "Toronto Pearson"]
// << üîµ Run Point
//:
//: -------------------
//:
//: Swift‚Äôs `Dictionary` type doesn‚Äôt have a defined ordering. To iterate over the keys or values of a dictionary in a specific order, use the `sorted()` method on its `keys` or `values` property.
